// Bot-fidelity pin for the HTTPS surface. Like SSH, the TLS port deliberately never
// completes a handshake: it captures the ClientHello and holds the socket open,
// writing nothing. The machine-observable consequence is an all-zero JARM and an
// nmap "tcpwrapped" label — a conscious trade (terminating real TLS would expose
// Go's own JARM/JA3S, which would not match nginx+OpenSSL anyway). This test pins
// the zero-bytes-written behaviour so it can never regress into Go's default TLS
// stack, and confirms the ClientHello is still classified and captured.
