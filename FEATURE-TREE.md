# SweeTTY Feature Tree

Coverage index of implemented behaviour. Each entry states an invariant and cites
the test that verifies it; an entry whose cited test is absent is a defect in this
file. Design rationale lives in the companion docs ([VISION.md](./VISION.md),
[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md), [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md),
[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)); this file records only what is verified. Citations read
`package: TestName`.

## Verify

- `go build ./...` compiles every package and the embedded fakeroots.
- `go test ./...` is the full gate; every cited entry is one of these tests.
- `go vet ./...` and `gofmt -l .` report nothing.
- Boundary subsets:
  - `go test ./internal/safety/` (import guardrail).
  - `go test ./internal/proto/telnet/ -run 'TestNoOutboundConnectionOrExec|TestShellWritesNoHostByte|TestOverlayEvaporatesAcrossSessions'` (egress, host-disk, overlay lifetime).
  - `go test ./internal/crosscheck/` (one persona across services).
